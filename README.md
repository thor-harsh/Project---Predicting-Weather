# Project---Predicting-Weather

<table>
  Applying machine learning to nowcasting, allows us to increase the accuracy and speed of making these predictions. 
  Deep learning models can be built to find weather patterns of cloud behavior by training it with satellite imagery.
  But here I have used very simple classifier model for weather prediction because it was not weather forecasting soon 
  I will publish the deep learning model also for weather forecasting.

  Thanks
